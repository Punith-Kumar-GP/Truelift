Hi Jaskirat,I have made the feature as said by you ,please look into it. I have made everything under single component, Initially you can drag and drop and select the file .csv files it will read and create a timeline you hover over the timelines to see the dates, and then there is a button for create Subset where the initially the dates are prefilled according to the original timeline then user can add their desired timelines , I have added some validations also like user cannot select any date beyond the original timeline and the end dates cannot be before start date and then user can give a name and submit which will create a new timeline and the user selected dates will highlighted.
